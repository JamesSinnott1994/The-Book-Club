### Code Validation

#### Testing CSS with the [Jigsaw CSS Validation Service ](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
- There was 1 error relating to the value for the font-weight:
![CSS Error](readme-images/css-error.png)

- Warnings were also discovered, but these relate mainly to "unknown vendor extensions", which can be safely ignored.

#### Testing JavaScript with [JSHint](https://jshint.com/)

- When I Initially put my app.js code into JSHint, I was given 17 warnings:

![JSHint-Warning-One](readme-images/jshint-warnings.png)

- As can be seen from the image above, most of the warnings related to ES6's `let` keywords.
    - This is a minor warning. The solution to get rid of the warning was to add the following comment to the top of the app.js file:
        - /*jshint esversion: 6 */
    - This had the affect of reducing the warnings from 17 to 1.

- The remaining warning was about a missing semi-colon, which was easily fixed.

- JSHint also had an issue with undefined variable '$', used for jQuery. The solution was to put the following at the top of the app.js file:
    - /*globals $:false */

#### Testing Python with [PEP8 online](http://pep8online.com/)

- When I initially put my app.py code into the PEP8 validator, I was given 2 minor issues:

![PEP8-Issues](readme-images/pep8-issues.png)

- This was in relation to the following code:

    - "$skip": (
            pagination_data["BOOKS_PER_PAGE"]
            * (pagination_data["offset"] + int(page))
        )

- Solution was simply to move the multiply operator '*' back to the first line:

    - "$skip": (
            pagination_data["BOOKS_PER_PAGE"] *
            (pagination_data["offset"] + int(page))
        )
