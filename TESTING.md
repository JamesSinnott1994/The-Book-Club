### Code Validation

#### Testing JavaScript with [JSHint](https://jshint.com/)

- When I Initially put my app.js code into JSHint, I was given 17 warnings:

![JSHint-Warning-One](readme-images//jshint-warnings.PNG)

- As can be seen from the image above, most of the warnings related to ES6's `let` keywords.
    - This is a minor warning. The solution to get rid of the warning was to add the following comment to the top of the app.js file:
        - /*jshint esversion: 6 */
    - This had the affect of reducing the warnings from 17 to 1.

- The remaining warning was about a missing semi-colon, which was easily fixed.

- JSHint also had an issue with undefined variable '$', used for jQuery. The solution was to put the following at the top of the app.js file:
    - /*globals $:false */
